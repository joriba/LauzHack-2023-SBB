class ServiceAlteration:
    """Status (realtime changes) to a `ServiceJourney` and might impact planned routing.

    Attributes:
        cancelled (bool): true: Journey is `cancelled` (de:Ausfall), default=false.
        partially_cancelled (bool): true: Journey is partially cancelled (de:Teilausfall) at beginning or end,
            default=false.
        reachable (bool): true: vehicle (`ServiceProduct`) change connection from `PTRideLeg` to `PTRideLeg` is possible
            (de: Anschluss kann gehalten werden, see `Trip::status::valid`); false: de:nicht mehr erreichbare Fahrt Default:
            True.
        redirected (bool): true: journey is redirected (aka OJP deviation).
        cancelled_formatted (Union[Unset, str]): If `cancelled`, enduser cancellation info.<br>(Translated according to
            Accept-Language.) Example: Ausfall.
        partially_cancelled_formatted (Union[Unset, str]): If `partiallyCancelled`, enduser info.<br>(Translated
            according to Accept-Language.) Example: Ausfall.
        reachable_formatted (Union[Unset, str]): Transport-product change from Leg to Leg info according to SBB business
            rules. Relates to reachable. Example: Your connecting train will be waiting, please change trains immediately..
        redirected_formatted (Union[Unset, str]): Text intended for passengers about a planned stop being skipped,
            relates to `redirected`.<br>(Translated according to Accept-Language.) Example: This vehicle is not stopping at
            all stations..
        unplanned_stop_points_formatted (Union[Unset, str]): Text intended for passengers about an additional non-
            planned stop at a station.<br>(Translated according to Accept-Language.) Example: This vehicle is making
            exceptional stops. This can lead to increased travel time..
        delay_formatted (Union[Unset, str]): Enduser text, saying whether there is a delay on PTRideLeg (referring to
            first/last Stop).<br>(Translated according to Accept-Language.) Example: Delay.
        quay_changed_formatted (Union[Unset, str]): Enduser text, saying whether there is a `Quay` change on
            `ServiceJourney` (typically referring to first and/or last `ScheduledStopPoint` on a `PTRideLeg`), which
            indicates the passengers to be careful at boarding/alighting.<br>(Translated according to Accept-Language.)
            Example: GleisÃ¤nderung.
